BufferSize (size of array called Buffer) is set to large number
PlaybackBuffer (amount of Buffer available to manipulate)
PlaybackIndex (variable for what spot in the array is being accesssed [aka what sample in that spot is being outputted])
PlaybackSpeed (variable for how playback index steps through array)



User taps in tempo (1st tap starts input of counted samples, 2nd tap stops input of counted samples)
Amount of samples inputted within those two taps represents 1 beats. This size is stored to variable (ie "BeatSize")
PlaybackBuffer changes to the size of BeatSize * 8 (to get a manipulable buffer size of 8 beats)


Basic Manipulation design:
(example)
User presses Beat Repeat option, playback switches to "Wet"
As soon as the button is pressed, a variable LoopStart is set to the point in the array that marks the start of the beat being manipulated (repeated)
This automatically sets variable LoopEnd to the spot in the array that's 1 beat from LoopStart (value of BeatSize")
This section between LoopStart and LoopEnd is repeated while user continues to hold down Beat Repeat button
Once they release button, LoopStart and LoopEnd reset to zero.
Playback goes back to "Dry" playback
